Employing Tailwind CSS for styling the website, I employed Typescript, a superset of Javascript, to implement the website's functionality. For content management, I integrated Sanity.io into the platform. To ensure robust security in user authentication, I implemented NextAuth, incorporating both Google and Credentials as authentication providers. Currently, I am in the process of resolving remaining bugs and implementing additional features, a task I anticipate will be completed within a week.",
